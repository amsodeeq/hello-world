# hello-world
Greetings to the world!
Sodeeq here, I like R Programming, using it for Machine Learning, Tableau for graphical tools and Mysql for managing the database.
I employed R tools to solve problems confronting the growth of an organisation and the people with focus on Education Reforms, Business Intelligence, and Technological Integration.
